We encourage you to click the "Tips and Exercises" page on the main menu and try the tips and suggestions under "Stress" and "Arguments and Conflicts".</p><p><b>Last Month - </b> Compared to the last month, you have had a similarly neutral week. Despite unhappy moments and a few difficult days, you have been stable and consistent.
